## üìò Overview

The OUSL Final Exam Target Calculator is a simple yet powerful academic planning tool built specifically for students of the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL). This tool allows you to calculate the minimum score you need in your final examination based on your current OCAM (Overall Continuous Assessment Marks) in order to achieve your desired final grade.

This calculator was developed out of a real need: many students, especially newcomers or those managing multiple subjects, often find themselves wondering how much they need to score in their final exam to secure a particular grade. This app was built to solve that uncertainty, motivate students, and help them better plan their revision and exam preparation.

This is NOT a GPA calculator, but a grade-targeting tool based on the official weightage system of OCAM (40%) and Final Exam (60%) commonly used in the Faculty of Natural Sciences at OUSL.

### Core Purpose
> ‚úÖ Empower OUSL students with clarity on their final exam targets and keep them motivated!

Built with simplicity and precision in mind, this tool takes the guesswork out of exam preparation and helps you strategize effectively.

## üí° Why This Tool?

> "I often saw friends struggle with planning their studies because they didn‚Äôt know what score to aim for. So I built this."  
> ‚Äî *Rathnakumar Abishek, Developer*

üìå **Key Benefits:**
- Provides **clarity** on what‚Äôs needed to succeed
- Helps you **strategize effort** for realistic goals
- Turns vague grade aspirations into actionable targets

Whether you‚Äôre aiming to pass or chasing an A+, this tool shows you what‚Äôs possible and what it‚Äôll take.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

OUSL‚Äôs grading system uses a **weighted average**:
- **OCAM**: 40% of your final mark
- **Final Exam**: 60% of your final mark

### Example Calculation
- OCAM = 50
- OCAM contribution = 40% of 50 = **20 marks**
- Target final grade = A (70 total)
- Required final exam score = `(70 - 20) / 0.6 = 83.3 ‚Üí 84/100`

The app automates this process and presents it in an intuitive interface.
